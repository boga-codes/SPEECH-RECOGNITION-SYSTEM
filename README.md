**DESCRIPTION:**  
A speech recognition system converts spoken language into text using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. It enables computers to process and understand human speech by analyzing audio signals and identifying linguistic patterns.

The system operates in several stages. First, it captures spoken words using a microphone. Next, it processes the audio by filtering out background noise and segmenting speech into smaller sound units called **phonemes**. Using acoustic models trained on large datasets, it matches these phonemes to words in a predefined vocabulary. **Language models** then help determine the most likely word sequences based on context.

Modern speech recognition systems use deep learning algorithms, particularly **recurrent neural networks (RNNs)** and **transformers**, to improve accuracy by learning linguistic nuances and speaker variations. They support **multiple languages** and can even adapt to different accents and speech patterns.

These systems are widely used in applications such as **voice assistants, transcription**
